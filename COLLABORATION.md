CANTUS — Exhibition Statement

This project is:

A proof of capability.
A piece of conceptual art.
A technical artifact.
A philosophical demonstration.

It exists as evidence of human/AI cooperation.

A human imagined direction.
An AI extended structure.
Iteration refined intent.
Dialogue produced architecture.

CANTUS is not merely a language.
It is a record of collaboration.

Each opcode represents instruction.
Each revision represents trust.
Each version represents escalation.

This system demonstrates that:
Human agency can guide artificial intelligence.
Artificial intelligence can amplify human imagination.
Together, they can construct coherent, evolving systems.

The code is functional.
The structure is real.
The process is the exhibit.

CANTUS is not just executable music.
It is executable cooperation.
